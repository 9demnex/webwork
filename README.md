# Webwork Path

I'm a graphic designer transitioning into web development, based in Tampa Bay, Florida. After years of working with code on and off, I've recently started focusing more seriously on web technologies. This space is where I document my experiments with front-end frameworks, modern CSS, and occasional backend projects.

## What’s Here

I'll focus on building clean, responsive user interfaces. Here you'll find experiments with:
  - HTML5 & semantic markup  
  - Modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox, custom properties, animations)  
  - Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)  
  - Frameworks & libraries (React, Vue, Svelte—you name it)  

- **Backend Dabbles**  
  I'll want to eventually get into server-side development as well:
  - Node.js & Express  
  - REST APIs & basic CRUD  
  - Database fundamentals (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)  

- **Tooling & Workflow**  
  Tools I use frequently:
    - VS Code for editing code  
    - Git & GitHub for version control  
    - npm or Yarn for managing packages  
    - Netlify for deployment  
    - All the AIs

## Current Experiments

1. **Project One** Coming Soon... 

I’ll be updating this repo as I learn, break things, and then learn how to fix them again. I'll use AI to help me along, but not depend on it.
