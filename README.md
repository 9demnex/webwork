# Webwork Path

Hello! I’m a graphic designer turned web developer living the in Tampa Bay, Florida (Go Bucs!). I’ve been dabbling in code on and off for years, but lately I’ve caught a serious case of the web-dev bug. This is my little corner of the internet where I experiment with new front-end frameworks, play with cutting-edge CSS tricks, and even dip my toes into backend waters from time to time.

## What’s Here

I'll focus on building clean, responsive user interfaces. Here you'll find experiments with:
  - HTML5 & semantic markup  
  - Modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox, custom properties, animations)  
  - Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)  
  - Frameworks & libraries (React, Vue, Svelte—you name it)  

- **Backend Dabbles**  
  I'll want to eventually get into server-side development as well:
  - Node.js & Express  
  - REST APIs & basic CRUD  
  - Database fundamentals (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)  

- **Tooling & Workflow**  
  Tools I use frequently:
    - VS Code for editing code  
    - Git & GitHub for version control  
    - npm or Yarn for managing packages  
    - Netlify for deployment  
    - All the AIs

## Current Experiments

1. **Project One** Coming Soon... 

I’ll be updating this repo as I learn, break things, and then learn how to fix them again. I'll use AI to help me along, but not depend on it.
