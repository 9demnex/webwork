# Web Dev Experiment Playground

Hey there! I’m a graphic designer turned web developer living the sun-soaked life in Tampa Bay, Florida 🌴. I’ve been dabbling in code on and off for years, but lately I’ve caught a serious case of the web-dev bug. This is my little corner of the internet where I experiment with new front-end frameworks, play with cutting-edge CSS tricks, and even dip my toes into backend waters from time to time.

## 🧰 What’s Here

- **Frontend Focus**  
  I’m all about crafting sleek, responsive interfaces. Expect me to tinker with:
  - HTML5 & semantic markup  
  - Modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox, custom properties, animations)  
  - Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)  
  - Frameworks & libraries (React, Vue, Svelte—you name it)  

- **Backend Dabbles**  
  Once in a while I swap my pixel-pushing hat for a server-side one:
  - Node.js & Express  
  - REST APIs & basic CRUD  
  - Database fundamentals (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)  

- **Tooling & Workflow**  
  Because a smooth setup = more time for fun experiments:
  - VS Code + ‍ Extensions  
  - Git & GitHub (feature branches, pull requests, GitHub Pages)  
  - npm / Yarn scripts  
  - Build tools (Webpack, Vite)

## 🚀 Current Experiments

1. **Component-Driven Design** with Storybook  
2. **CSS Houdini** to push custom painting hooks  
3. **Serverless Functions** on Netlify / Vercel  
4. **Headless CMS** (Strapi & Sanity.io) integration  
5. **Progressive Web App** (PWA) basics  

I’ll be updating this repo as I learn, break things, and then learn how to fix them again. Feel free to poke around my branches or open an issue if you’ve got tips, tricks, or spooky funny bugs you want to share.
